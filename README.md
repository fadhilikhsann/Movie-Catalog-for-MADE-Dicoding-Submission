# Movie Catalog Apps
My Movie Catalog Apps project using Java

## Description

I create a movie catalog application that has features such as displaying a list of movies to the details, searching for movies by
title, setting the language used in displaying the list or details of the movies and creating reminder notifications for the movies release date on the current day. While on progress.<br>

During the application development progress, I began to learn a lot about how to implement the MVVM architecture in the process of creating android applications using the Java programming language, create layouts using ContraintLayout, and make API requests to https://api.themoviedb.org to get response data in JSON format that will be used in the application such as to displays response data that has been processed by the
application using the RecyclerView.
